/*
CAN BUS is used with extended frame format. This allows 29 bit identifiers.
We use the 7 MSBs as node id, even if the board as only a 4 bit dip, to
leave space to improvement.

Please note that we don't use message ids to handle also priority,
where in can bus lower message id has higher priority, since we don't need it.
I prefered (and need) to build the id to be able to address each node
in order to get where it is and what it has attached to it.

Special nodes id:
0x0 : the master node (raspberry in detectino project).
0x7f: the broadcast address

The other bits are used to identify destination and commands.

so here's the bit map:
id

23-29 : node id (source, read from dips)
16-22 : destination node id
 8-15 : command
 0- 7 : subcommand
